As the name suggests this Deep Learning project is used for Thyroid Detection. Thyroid Dataset taken from UCI consists of 3772 instances, 30 attributes of which 24 attributes are categorical and 6 attributes are continuous. All instances are classified as either Positive or Negative. This project uses RNN based models such as Vanilla LSTM, Stacked LSTM, Bi-Directional LSTM and Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU). This project has an accuracy around 92%, with Vanilla LSTM having least loss.
